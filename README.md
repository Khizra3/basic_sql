# basic_sql

Running basic SQL queries and understanding what to acheive is the main #GOAL. 

Multiple questions arise when you start writing your first query, so a tip from my side, 'Ask as many questions until your understanding is achieved!'
Ms. Sidra Cheema in our SQL practoce class agreed with me, because we can have a different understanding of each question.

So, what will you do on your job when you are asked by manager to give asnwers of 10 random queries regarding the data??
